AWS elastic beanstalk error correct

The instance profile aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role associated with the environment does not exist.


on the AWS console search I AM  then open it and go to roles then create roles then AWS service and use case EC2 
	next then add these three permissions	 AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier		AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier		AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker
